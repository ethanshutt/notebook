Title: Gallery

----

Text: 

Each page has a gallery function built-in automatically. 

#### How it works
Each page is built from the `default.yml` blueprint and the `default.php` template.

The blueprint for the gallery is very simple.
``` 
gallery:
    label: Does this page have a gallery?
    type: toggle
    text: yes/no 
```

Whereas the code from the template and snippet are where the majority of the work is done.

`default.php` - page template
```
<?php snippet('gallery') ?>
```

`gallery.php` - gallery snippet
```
<?php if ($page->gallery()->bool()) : ?>
  <section id="gallery">
    <div class="container med-container">
    <?php if ($page->hasImages()): ?>
        <?php foreach($page->images() as $image) : ?>
          <img src="<?= $image->url() ?>" alt="" class="full-width">
        <?php endforeach ?>
      <?php else : ?>
        <h4 class="text-center">Yikes!</h4>
        <p class="text-center">There should be a gallery here! <br /> But there aren't any images showing up.</p>
    <?php endif ?>
    </div>
  </section>
<?php endif ?>
```

Intro: 

Pages automatically have gallery functionality built in.
Each page's gallery is built simply by adding an image to the “Files” tab of a page.
