> #### A word on CSS Variables
> All modern browsers have support for Variables and Custom Properties. 
> The current chart on [CanIUse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=variables) puts support at around 93% global users. Most notably, there is **zero** support for IE (2% Global) and Opera Mini (1.3%).

## Thanks
The idea behind this project was mostly inspired by Tania Rascia's [Primitive](https://github.com/taniarascia/primitive).

It aims to make the starting process much faster, simpler, and organized.
