# Notebook Framework

A modern, lightweight framework built with vanilla CSS.

## Goals:
- Mobile First
- Vanilla CSS
- Universal Browser Compatibility
> #### A word on CSS Variables
> All modern browsers have support for Variables and Custom Properties. 
> The current chart on [CanIUse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=variables) puts support at around 93% global users. Most notably, there is **zero** support for IE (2% Global) and Opera Mini (1.3%).*
