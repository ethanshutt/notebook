## Goals:
- Neutral Styles

> #### A word on CSS Variables
> All modern browsers have support for Variables and Custom Properties. 
> The current chart on [CanIUse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=variables) puts support at around 93% global users. Most notably, there is **zero** support for IE (2% Global) and Opera Mini (1.3%).
